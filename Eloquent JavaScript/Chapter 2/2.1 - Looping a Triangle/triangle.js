/*
    Looping a triangle

    Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following
    triangle:
        #
        ##
        ###
        ####
        #####
        ######
        #######

    It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.
    
        let abc = "abc";
        console.log(abc.length);
        // â†’ 3
        38
*/

window.onload = function()
{
    let output = "";

    while (output.length < 7)
    {
        output += "#";
        console.log(output);
    }
}
