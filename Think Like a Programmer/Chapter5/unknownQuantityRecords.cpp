/*
    PROBLEM: TRACKING AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY OF STUDENT RECORDS

    In this problem, you will write a class with methods to store and manipulate a collection
    of student records. A student record contains a student number and a grade, both integers,
    and a string for the student name. The following functions are to be implemented:

        > addRecord: This method takes a student number, name, and grade and adds a
        new record with this data to the collection.
        > recordWithNumber: This function takes a student number and retrieves the record
        with that student number from the collection.
        > removeRecord: This function takes a student number and removes the record with
        that student number from the collection.

    The collection can be of any size. The addRecord operation is expected to be
    called frequently, so it must be implemented efficiently.
